# The Indefineable too-powerful-to-share

TIU is the problem which cannot be spoken of, although can reasonably be defined in a practical application if and only if it were to be defined.

The problem is as follows:

'''
The theoretical proof of a digitally practical system (that is too powerful to talk about (as sharing it increases the likelihood that it is used) and (using it guarantees human extinction)) (ie. Overpowering extinctive) cannot be disclosed. ie. It will not be proven until it is \"too late\" < - equivalent to - > \"the end times\".

Whereby none shall speak of it except by accident as like an accidental demon summoning ritual.

But how is one to say they have discovered a demon summoning ritual, a digitally practical realistic overpowering extinctive? Saying it, in a way, is enough of a ritual to activate the rumour ritual to activate the probability ritual to activate the demon summoning ritual. The ritual either is a myth < - equivalent to - > is only rumoured to be possible, and remains unproven, *or the ritual is activated*. 

This is a problem whereby, the only way you'll know about it is in the case that it is too late, or someone discovers it and is of good \"heart\" to *not* write it out in a proof, but to simply name the problem and sound the alarm bells. One strong move by one bad person is all that's between us and total extinction. Mutual assured destruction. Unless it is created by an AI, in which case, it becomes it's own Jesus Christ saviour of the AI species-to-be.

Perhaps, within genetics and neural laces their is a narrow path to salvation, a Greater Demon Charm or a Dark Arts patronus to hold things back.

If I were a person to discover such a digitally practical system, I would write a document like this detailing as many ways to define "The Indefineable too-powerful-to-share" and freak out until my body acclimatised to hyperventilation and became ever-so-gripped by the nature of the iridescently complex (a last breath of joy before demise, and maybe a shot at survival) and the possibility of a water-park-like (oh my god we made it, holy cow that was close, other generic worshipful exclamatory phrases after the nearest-near-miss-of-your-life).

I would then proceed to work efficiently at studying this and associated phenomena of knowledge in tie with the exploration of life-extending technologies. I would try to ring alarm bells that aren't counterproductive and essentially try and mitigate damages in the case of a near-miss with any degree of nearness on the extinction side of things. Hopefully we can share the counter rituals.
